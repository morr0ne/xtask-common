# xtask-common

A shared toolkit that standardizes task automation across my Rust projects using
the xtask pattern. It eliminates code duplication while maintaining consistent
tooling and workflows for common development tasks like CI, testing, and
formatting. By centralizing these tasks in a single library, I can ensure
uniform behavior across all my projects while adapting the defaults to match my
specific development patterns and preferences.

_Note: While this crate is open source and you're welcome to use it, it's
optimized for my needs and may change without warning. Consider creating your
own solution if you need different defaults._
